I am board certified in Anatomic Pathology after training at Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH) and am currently a fellow in Molecular Genetic Pathology, also at BWH, as well as a Clinical Fellow at Harvard Medical School. I hold an MD from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and a BA in Mathematics from Oberlin College.

I am a member of the [Mahmood Lab](https://faisal.ai/) where we study how AI can improve diagnostics. My interests include digital pathology, computational pathology, and molecular pathology.

My prior research projects have spanned from Raman spectroscopic analysis of butadienes, to morphometrics of bones from the [Hamann-Todd Osteological Collection](https://www.cmnh.org/phys-anthro/collection-database) to improve orthopedic surgery outcomes, to evolutionary approaches to cancer cell modelling. Generally, my focus has been on using quantitative and computational techniques to improve medicine.
