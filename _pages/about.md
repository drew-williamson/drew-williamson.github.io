I am board certified in Anatomic Pathology after training at Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH) and am currently a fellow in Molecular Genetic Pathology, also at BWH, as well as a Clinical Fellow at Harvard Medical School. I am a member of the [Mahmood Lab](https://faisal.ai/). My interests include digital pathology, computational pathology, and molecular pathology. I hold an MD from Case Western Reserve University and a BA in Mathematics from Oberlin College.
